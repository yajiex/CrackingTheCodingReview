## Partition

### Solution

```js
'use strict';

/**
 * Travel through list and elements bigger than the pivot element are put at the tail and elments smaller are put at the head. Each time we insert an element, we update either the head or tail.
 *
 * N = |list|
 * Time: O(N)
 * Additional space: O(1) -> as new structures aren't being created, original
 * list is being manipulated.
 */
function partition(node, x) {
  let head = node;
  let tail = node;
  
  while (node) {
    const next = node.next;
    if (node.val < x) {
      node.next = head;
      head = node;
    } else {
      tail.next = node;
      tail = node;
    }
    node = next;
  }
  tail.next = null;
  return head;
}

/* helper
function arrToList(arr) {
  const head = {};
  let p = head;
  arr.forEach(x => {
    const node = { val: x };
    p.next = node;
    p = node;
  });
  p.next = null;
  return head.next;
}

function listToArr(list) {
  let p = list;
  const arr = [];
  while(p) {
    arr.push(p.val);
    p = p.next;
  }
  return arr;
}
*/
```

### Test case

```js
[
    [[5], 4],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 3],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 31],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 5],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 30],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 9],
    [[5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 15, 30], 10]
]
```

### Points

1. One corner case is the single-element list. Above solution is still able to handle that and won't cause cycled linked list as we will break the cycle by `tail.next = null`.
